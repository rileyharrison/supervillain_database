**** // TODO database connection string!

***
TODO dependencies. For each thing that changes, make note of what needs to change where.
Database: new database name for each project, or else you will overwrite the existing database.
You will need to change the database name in the connection string (mongoURI) in db.js.
Models: in server > models > , you need a file for each model, such as villain.js, lair.js
When Models change, the following code is affected:
server > models > noun.js
index.js: var declaration and require
index.js: router get and post
controllers.js:  villainService, scope.villains, scope.addVillain
factories.js: lots
add.html lots
home.html: instructions
view.html: nouns
index.html: title h1 nouns
app.js: nothing



index changes indicate change get and post calls from lower
also indicate changes in form fields in views
controlers indicates changes in factories
TODO

@channel: My STRONG recommendation of work the next couple nights:
Build an application that uses Angular Routing, Factories, MongoDB, and organizationally on the Server is modular (what we did today).

Three views:
1 View that lays out directions on how to use the application,
2 View that collections information off a form using Text Entries and Drop Downs, all saving to one object
3 View that displays information entered from the view

The goal is to be able to set up such a project is roughly 2.5 hours. Once again, to verbalize what you would
 be able to do in 2.5 hours, is set up a MEAN Stack application, with a CRD (Missing update) interface, all following the MVC pattern.

[4:23]
Proud of you all, you all have done some incredible work this past 6 weeks.

tasks:
 1. build directions into home view, label instructions as such.
 2. modify "add" form so that rather than doing a search, it lets you take stuff off of a form and save it. NOTE include dropdowns
 3. modify "view" form so that there are buttons for "delete"
